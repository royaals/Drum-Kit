# Drum Kit

The Drum Kit project is a fun and interactive web application that allows users to play virtual drums using their computer keyboard or by clicking on drum buttons on the screen. The web page displays a set of drum buttons corresponding to different keys on the keyboard, and each drum button is associated with a unique drum sound. Users can press the corresponding keys or click the buttons to produce drum sounds and create their own beats.
